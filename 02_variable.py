#Python does not have command for declaring a variable
#Variables are created the moment when they are assigned values

#str
carname = "Volvo" 
print(carname)

#int
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y

#naming rules
#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#A variable name cannot start with a number
#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
