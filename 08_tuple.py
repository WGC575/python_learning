#A tuple is a collection that is ordered and unchangeable

#Constructor tuple()
tuple_new = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
print(tuple_new)

#Accessing method is the same as List. The difference is that members are unchangeable.
#add, remove do not work with tuples
print(tuple_new[1])


#len and other methods that do not change the tupke still work

#count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
#index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
